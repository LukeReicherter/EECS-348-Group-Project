During this meeting, we coordinated our availability to schedule a recurring weekly team meeting, aimed at reviewing each memberâ€™s progress on the project. Additionally, we brainstormed potential names for our group. We also discussed our individual programming backgrounds and experience and created a group chat. Luke also created the GitHub repository and sent invites out to each team member.

We are designating roles at our next meeting when everyone in our group is present.
